Videos are a must-have in social media marketing today because they’re one of the best ways to grab attention and boost engagement. **People are far more likely to interact with video than any other type of content, which means more likes, shares, and comments for your brand**.

## Why Convert Your Website into Video?

[Social media platforms love videos!](https://bluetext.com/blog/social-media-algorithms-how-to-optimize-your-content-for-maximum-reach/) Their algorithms prioritize video content, pushing it to the top of users' feeds, so you're more likely to get noticed by a wider audience. **When you use videos, you're not just increasing your visibility, you're also creating memorable, impactful content that builds brand awareness and trust**.

Therefore, incorporating video content of your website into your social media strategy is essential for:

- **Enhance Engagement**: Videos naturally draw people in and make it easier to hold their attention. This keeps them interested and makes it easier for them to understand what your site has to offer.

- **Showcase Features Effectively**: Use video to showcase your website’s key features, your new branding, or guide users through the site. This keeps them interested, encouraging them to click through and explore more!

- **Increase Shareability**: Video content is far more likely to be shared on social media compared to text or images. If users find your video compelling, they’ll want to share it, helping you expand your brand’s reach.
